# HAND KEYPOINT DETECTION

This is a repo to execute live hand keypoint generation using OpenCV as implemented by https://www.learnopencv.com/hand-keypoint-detection-using-deep-learning-and-opencv/

I have added the model in the hand directory as the model has been taken down from the source provided.
The input video is saved as osy_test.mp4 and can be used by uncommenting the input_source variable.
The index for input cam is set as 0 by default and can be changes at the time of calling or in the '__init__' function if the class
The result has been stored in output.avi file
